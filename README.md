# #aesthetic

I want everything in my workflow to be automated. This is a baby step towards that.

Currently, this is a ragtag collection of two modules:

## Aesthetic Changer

I like changing the entire 'look' of my GNOME desktop- theme, wallpaper, text editor themes, shell profile- according to my mood. Doing it by hand using the individual tools all the time is time-consuming. This module changes the look of my gnome desktop at a single shell command, to one of several user-defined 'aesthetics'.

An 'aesthetic' currently includes:
	- wallpaper
	- theme

## Project

Downloads or refreshes any of my projects that are stored on another machine or on a VCS like git. Requires an external file called "project\_details.json".
